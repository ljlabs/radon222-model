kyle jordaan phy 312 radon detector Demo

this is the demo application that will be using the radon Detector
(detector.py) class to measure the energy lost by radon 222 during its radon_decay
process in side of an EPERM L-chamber. this data is then graphed using matplotlib
and displayed in a web browser
